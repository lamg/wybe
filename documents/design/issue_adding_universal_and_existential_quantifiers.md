Right now the system only knows about 0‑ary predicates, propositional connectives and (Leibniz) equality. If you
    simply add two new DU cases
        | Forall of string * Pred<'a>  
        | Exists of string * Pred<'a>  

    you will immediately run into all of the following failures:
        1. **Incomplete pattern‐matches in `toTypedExpr`**
           In `TypedExpression.Pred<'a>` the `ITypedExpr.toTypedExpr` method does a big `match this with …` over exactly
     the constructors
           `{ True; False; Var; Bool; Not; And; Or; Equiv; Differs; Implies; Follows }`.
           As soon as you introduce `Forall`/`Exists`, the F# compiler will warn that your match is non‐exhaustive, and
    at runtime calling `toTypedExpr` on a quantifier will give you a `MatchFailureException` (or fall through to the
    `failwith "not impl"` in the `Rel` case if you happen to route them there).
        2. **Type‐checker treats everything as a curried function**
           The little type‐checker in `calculateType` only knows about `TypeId` and `Fun` and never tracks bound vs.
    free variables.  If you give “∀” or “∃” a `Fun [domain; ℬ]` signature, the mechanics will “type‐check” it, but
    you’ve lost all notion of “this variable is bound here”—so nothing prevents you from accidentally capturing or
    substituting variables under the binder.
        3. **Rewriting / substitution is capture‑unsafe**
           `ExpressionMatch.matchTree` and `rewrite` only look at node‐equality and subtree‐counts.  They will happily
    descend into the body of a quantifier and start matching or replacing variable names, with no renaming or scope
    tracking.  In practice that means
            * you’ll rewrite under quantifiers when you shouldn’t,
            * you’ll capture free variables mistakenly,
            * or your `leafOrSameLength` guards will silently prevent any rewrite under the binder if it doesn’t line up
     with the pattern tree’s arity.
        4. **Inference engine has no ∀/∃ rules**
           All of the rules in `Inference.fs` are hard‑coded to look for
            * Leibniz‐laws of the form `x = y ⇒ f.x = f.y`
            * transitivity laws of the form `x = y ∧ y = z ⇒ x = z`
                 …and so on.  There is no notion of ∀‐introduction, ∀‐elimination, ∃‐introduction or ∃‐elimination.  Any
     proof that even mentions a quantifier will simply never match any rule, so your proof‐checker will either silently
    skip those steps or report “no applicable rule.”
        5. **Pretty‑printer / inspector can’t render binders**
           The `Inspect.Formatters` module only knows how to walk a `TypedExpr` tree of boolean operators and equality.
     If you pass it a quantifier node it will either:
            * fall through to the default `Tree` printer (ugly),
            * or blow up on an unhandled case.
    –––
    Bottom‑line: if you just tack on Forall and Exists without touching all of
      • the Pred<'a> DU and its toTypedExpr method
      • the type‐checker (calculateType) if you want real binder‐semantics
      • the capture‑avoiding logic in ExpressionMatch
      • the new inference rules in Inference.fs
      • the pretty‑printer in Inspect
    you will get a mixture of compile‑time warnings/non‑exhaustive matches, runtime pattern‑match failures or failwith 
    "not impl", and—even if it does compile—a completely broken or unsound proof engine around your quantifiers.

## Wybe vs a professional theorem prover

Below is a high‑level comparison of what you get today in ExpressionMatch.matchTree/rewrite versus what a “real”
    theorem prover unifier does, and a handful of concrete steps you could take to bring your little engine closer to
    the pros.
        1. One‑way, leaf‑only pattern‐matching vs. two‑way full unification
           • ExpressionMatch
             – treats your “pattern” as a tree where any leaf node (i.e. a `Tree<'a>` with no children) is implicitly a
    pattern‐variable, and any non‑leaf must match arity exactly.
             – walks the tree once, accumulating a flat list of `(patternNode, subterm)` pairs, checks for trivial
    conflicts (`same patternNode` bound twice to different subterms), and that’s your “substitution.”
             – no occurs‑check, no propagation of earlier bindings, no composition of substitutions, no systematic
    treatment of variables at inner nodes.
           • A professional first‑order unifier
             – takes two arbitrary terms t₁, t₂ and builds a set of equations `E = {t₁ ≐ t₂}`.
             – maintains an explicit substitution σ (a map Var→Term), and processes `E` via a Martelli‑Montanari loop:
            • pick `x ≐ t` or `f(s₁,…,sₙ) ≐ f(t₁,…,tₙ)` or fail if heads differ
            • when you see `x ≐ t`, do an occurs‑check (fail if `x∈FV(t)`), extend σ, apply that binding across all of E
     (propagate)
            • iterate until E is empty.  What you get is the Most‑General‑Unifier (MGU).
             – Linear‑time (amortized) implementations use union‑find or hash‑consed DAGs, they index terms for fast
    rule retrieval, and they can do unification modulo theories (e.g. AC, commutativity) or even higher‑order in a
    restricted way.
        2. What you’re missing, and how to improve
            1. Explicit substitution environment
                  – Instead of a bare `List<(‘a * Tree<'a>)>`, introduce a `Subst = Map<Var,Term>` and carry it through
    the recursion.
                  – Whenever you bind `x ↦ t`, do an occurs‑check and immediately apply that binding to your “pending”
    pattern and target before recursing.
            2. Non‑leaf pattern variables
                  – Allow variables at internal nodes (not just leaves).  In the professional algorithm you don’t care
    if `x` appears as `f(x,y)` or just `x`, you treat any variable symbol the same.
            3. Occurs‑check
                  – Prevent infinite/cyclic terms by checking `x ∉ FV(t)` before you bind `x↦t`.  Without it you’ll
    happily unify `x` with `f(x)` and blow up later.
            4. Most‑General‑Unifier (MGU)
                  – Return the single “best” substitution, not the first match you see.  That lets you compose it with
    other inferences, compare solutions, cache them, etc.
            5. Term‑indexing for large rule sets
                  – If you want to scale from a handful of Leibniz/trans rules to hundreds of axioms, you’ll need a
    discrimination tree or substitution tree to quickly find only those rewrite rules whose LHS might unify with a given
     subterm.
            6. E‑ or AC‑unification
                  – If you ever want to reason modulo associativity/commutativity (e.g. +, ×) or other equational
    theories, you need specialized unification routines (or at least narrowing).
            7. Binder‑ and capture‑safe matching
                  – Once you add ∀, ∃ or λ, you must choose a representation (nominal with fresh‐name α‑renaming, or
    De Bruijn indices) and do unification under binders carefully—freshening bound variables at each match, avoiding
    capture.
            8. Performance and persistence
                  – Real provers use persistent (immutable) union‑find or DAG structures so that “undoing” a binding is
    cheap (for backtracking), and so that substitutions share structure rather than copying entire term trees.
    To get started, you could:
      • Write a small unify : Tree<'a> → Tree<'a> → Option<Subst> following the Martelli‑Montanari schema.
      • Replace matchTree/rewrite with calls into unify+applySubst.
      • Bake in an occurs‑check on variable bindings.
      • Later, add a discrimination‑tree index so that when you want to instantiate all laws whose LHS unify with a
    goal‐term you don’t brute‐scan the entire law database.
    That one change—moving from ad‑hoc leaf pattern matching to a proper MGU‐based unifier—will make your rewrite engine
     far more robust, compositional, and a lot closer to what mature first‑order theorem provers (e.g. lean, isabelle,
    E, or Vampire) are doing under the hood.
